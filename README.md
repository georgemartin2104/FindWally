# FindWally
Object Oriented Programming

This code will find a small reference image inside a larger image.
In this case I used a grayscale Wally as the reference image and a Where's Wally image in which he needs to be found.
This will of course work with any other images that are given instead, and if there is no match found in the larger image,
the script will instead circle the closest it finds to a match.
